[![build](https://github.com/a16z/magi/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/a16z/magi/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![license: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) [![chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-telegram-blue)](https://t.me/+IntDY_gZJSRkNTJj)

`magi` (pronounced may-jai) is an Optimism full node implemented in pure Rust.

## Quickstart

First install `magup`, Magi's installer:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a16z/magi/master/magup/install | bash
```

To install Magi, run `magup`.

## Configuration

`magi` exposes a number of configuration flags for executing the full node. To see a list of all available flags, run `magi --help`. This will print output similar to the following:

```bash
magi

USAGE:
    magi [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
        --data-dir <DATA_DIR>                [default: /Users/user/.magi/data]
    -e, --engine-api-url <ENGINE_API_URL>
    -h, --help                               Print help information
    -j, --jwt-secret <JWT_SECRET>
        --l1-rpc-url <L1_RPC_URL>
        --l2-rpc-url <L2_RPC_URL>
    -m, --sync-mode <SYNC_MODE>              [default: fast]
    -n, --network <NETWORK>                  [default: optimism-goerli]
```

By default, `magi` syncs in fast mode, querying other L2 nodes to construct the canonical L2 chain. This is the fastest, and most unsafe way to sync since it trusts L2 nodes to provide valid L2 blocks, that are batched to L1, but are not yet finalized. Safe, but non finalized blocks are blocks that are posted to L1, but have not yet past the fault proof window (7 days). This means that the block is not yet guaranteed to be part of the L2 canonical chain. The default mode does not require the sync flag to be specified, but it can be explicit, setting `--sync-mode` to `fast`.

Leveraging go-ethereum, the rollup node offers a p2p network that propogates "unsafe" L2 blocks.

Read more about the [Optimistic P2P rollup node](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/rollup-node-p2p.md).

Another more secure way to sync is to query L2 nodes for all _finalized L2 blocks_, and then run the derivation for all safe blocks that are still within the fault proof window. This mode can be specified using the `--sync-mode` flag, setting it to `challenge`.

Lastly, the fully trustless, most secure method of syncing is to _fully_ derive the L2 canonical chain from L1 blocks. This mode can be specified using the `--sync-mode` flag, setting it to `full`.

## Specifications

### Driver

The [Driver](./src/driver/mod.rs) is the highest-level component in `magi`. It is responsible for driving the L2 chain forward by processing L1 blocks and deriving the L2 chain from them.

On instantiation, the [Driver](./src/driver/mod.rs) is provided with an instance of the [Engine API](#engine-api), [Pipeline](#derivation-pipeline), and [Config](#config).

Advancing the driver forward one block is then as simple as calling the [Driver::advance](./src/driver/mod.rs#45) method as done in `magi`'s [main](./src/main.rs) binary.

Advancing the driver involves a few steps. First, the [Driver](./src/driver/mod.rs) will increment the [Pipeline](#derivation-pipeline) (as an iterator) to derive [PayloadAttributes](./src/engine/payload.rs). Then, the [Driver](./src/driver/mod.rs) will construct an [ExecutionPayload](./src/engine/payload.rs) that it can send through the [Engine API](#engine-api) as a `engine_newPayloadV1` request. Finally, the [ForkChoiceState](./src/engine/fork.rs) is updated by the driver, sending an `engine_forkchoiceUpdatedV1` request to the [Engine API](#engine-api).

At this point, `magi` has successfully advanced the L2 chain forward by one block, and the [Driver](./src/driver/mod.rs) should store the L2 Block in the [Backend DB](#backend-db).

### Engine API

The [EngineApi](./src/engine/mod.rs) exposes an interface for interacting with an external [execution client](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#execution-clients), in our case [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth) or [op-reth](https://github.com/rkrasiuk/op-reth) (soonâ„¢). Notice, we cannot use [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) as the execution client because Optimism's [execution client](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth) requires a [minimal diff](https://op-geth.optimism.io/) to the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/main/src/engine).

To construct an [EngineApi](./src/engine/mod.rs) as done in the `magi` [main binary](./src/main.rs), we must provide it with a base url (port is optional, and by default `8551`) as well as a 256 bit, hex-encoded secret string that is used to authenticate requests to the node. This secret is configured on the execution node's side using the `--authrpc.jwtsecret` flag. See [start-op-geth.sh](./scripts/start-op-geth.sh) for an example of how to configure and run an [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth) instance.

As mentioned in [Driver](#driver) section, the [Driver](./src/driver/mod.rs) uses the [EngineApi](./src/engine/mod.rs) to send constructed [ExecutionPayload](./src/engine/payload.rs) to the execution client using the [new_payload](./src/engine/api.rs) method. It also updates the [ForkChoiceState](./src/engine/fork.rs) using the [forkchoice_updated](./src/engine/api.rs) method.

Additionally, the [EngineApi](./src/engine/mod.rs) exposes a [get_payload](./src/engine/api.rs) method to fetch the [ExecutionPayload](./src/engine/payload.rs) for a given block hash.

### Derivation Pipeline

Although briefly touched upon in the [Driver](#driver) section, the [Derivation Pipeline](./src/derive/mod.rs) is responsible for much of `magi`'s functionality. It is used by the [Driver](#driver) to construct a [PayloadAttributes](./src/engine/payload.rs) from only an L1 RPC URL, passed through a [Config](#config) object.

When constructed, the [Pipeline](./src/derive/mod.rs) spawns a [L1 Chain Watcher](#l1-chain-watcher) and listens to the returned channel receivers for new L1 blocks and Deposit Transactions. It then uses it's [stages](./src/derive/stages/mod.rs) as iterators to sequentially construct a [PayloadAttributes](./src/engine/payload.rs) from the L1 blocks and Deposit Transactions.

The Pipeline is broken up into [stages](./src/derive/stages/mod.rs) as follows.

#### Stages

##### Batcher Transactions

The [Batcher Transactions](./src/derive/stages/batcher.rs) stage pulls transactions from it's configured channel receiver, passed down from the [Pipeline](./src/derive/mod.rs) parent. To construct a [BatcherTransaction](./src/derive/stages/batcher_transactions.rs) from the raw transaction data, it constructs [Frames](./src/derive/stages/batcher_transactions.rs) following the [Batch Submission Wire Format](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/derivation.md#batch-submission-wire-format) documented in the [Optimism Specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/README.md).

##### Channels

In the next stage, [Channels](./src/derive/stages/channels.rs), the [BatcherTransactions](./src/derive/stages/batcher.rs) is passed in and used as an iterator over the [BatcherTransaction](./src/derive/stages/batcher.rs) objects. The [Channels](./src/derive/stages/channels.rs) stage extracts [Frames](./src/derive/stages/batcher.rs) from the [BatcherTransaction](./src/derive/stages/batcher.rs) objects and places them in their corresponding [Channel](./src/derive/stages/channels.rs) objects. Since multiple channels can be built simultaneously, so-called `PendingChannel`s, the [Channel](./src/derive/stages/channels.rs) stage tracks if a channel is ready, and returns this when the Channel stage is called as an iterator.

Remember, since the [L1 Chain Watcher](#l1-chain-watcher) is spawned as a separate thread, it asynchronously feeds transactions and blocks over channels to the pipeline stages. As such, iterating over a stage like this one will return `None` until transactions are received from the [L1 Chain Watcher](#l1-chain-watcher) that can be split into frames and processed to fill up a full channel.

##### Batches

Next up, the [Batches](./src/derive/stages/batches.rs) stage iterates over the prior [Channel](./src/derive/stages/channels.rs) stage, decoding [Batch](./src/derive/stages/batches.rs) objects from the inner channel data. [Batch](./src/derive/stages/batches.rs) objects are RLP-decoded from the channel data following the [Batch Encoding Format](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/specs/derivation.md#batch-format), detailed below.

For version 0, [Batch](./src/derive/stages/batches.rs) objects are encoded as follows:

```golang
rlp_encode([parent_hash, epoch_number, epoch_hash, timestamp, transaction_list])
```

In this encoding,
- `rlp_encode` encodes batches following the RLP format
- `parent_hash` is the block hash of the previous L2 block
- `epoch_number`is the number of the L1 block corresponding to the sequencing epoch of the L2 block
- `epoch_hash` is the hash of the L1 block corresponding to the sequencing epoch of the L2 block
- `timestamp` is the timestamp of the L2 block
- `transaction_list` is an RLP-encoded list of EIP-2718 encoded transactions.

##### Attributes

Lastly, the [Pipeline](./src/derive/mod.rs) applies the [Attributes](./src/derive/stages/attributes.rs) stage to the previous [Batch](./src/derive/stages/batches.rs) stage, iterating over [Attributes](./src/derive/stages/attributes.rs).

In this step, the final [PayloadAttributes](./src/derive/stages/attributes.rs) object is constructed by combining the [Batch](./src/derive/stages/batches.rs) object data with it's corresponding L1 Block, as well as applying system configuration values like the `suggested_fee_recipient`, `no_tx_pool`, and `gas_limit`.

### L1 Chain Watcher

The L1 chain watcher is responsible for watching L1 for new blocks with deposits and batcher transactions. `magi` spawns the L1 [`ChainWatcher`](./src/l1/mod.rs) in a separate thread and uses channels to communicate with the upstream consumers.

In `magi`'s case, the upstream consumers are the [`Pipeline`](./src/derive/mod.rs), which contains an instance of the [`ChainWatcher`](./src/l1/mod.rs) and passes the channel receivers into the pipeline [stages](./src/derive/stages/mod.rs).

When constructed in the [`Pipeline`](./src/derive/mod.rs), the [`ChainWatcher`](./src/l1/mod.rs) is provided with a [Config](./src/config.rs) object that contains a critical config values for the L1 chain watcher. This includes:
- [L1 RPC Endpoint](./src/config/mod.rs#L11)
- [Deposit Contract Address](./src/config/mod.rs#L32)
- [Batch Sender Address](./src/config/mod.rs#L30)
- [Batch Inbox Address](./src/config/mod.rs#L30)

Note, when the `ChainWatcher` object is dropped, it will abort tasks associated with its handlers using [`tokio::task::JoinHandle::abort`](https://docs.rs/tokio/1.13.0/tokio/task/struct.JoinHandle.html#method.abort).

### Backend DB

The backend DB is an embedded database that uses [sled](https://docs.rs/sled/latest/sled/index.html) as its backend.
It stores [serde_json](https://docs.rs/serde_json/latest/serde_json/index.html) serialized blocks on disk and provides an interface for querying them. See an example below.

```rust
use magi::backend::prelude::*;

// Note: this will panic if both `/tmp/magi` and the hardcoded temporary location cannot be used.
let mut db = Database::new("/tmp/magi");
let block = ConstructedBlock {
    hash: Some(BlockHash::from([1; 32])),
    ..Default::default()
};
db.write_block(block.clone()).unwrap();
let read_block = db.read_block(block.hash.unwrap()).unwrap();
assert_eq!(block, read_block);
db.clear().unwrap();
```

Notice, we can use the `Database::new` method to create a new database at a given path. If the path is `None`, then the database will be created in a temporary location. We can also use the `Database::clear` method to clear the database.

Importantly, if the `ConstructedBlock` does not have it's `hash` set, the block `number` will be used as it's unique identifier.

### Config

The [Config](./src/config/mod.rs) object contains the system configuration for the `magi` node.

**Config**
- `l1_rpc`: The L1 RPC endpoint to use for the L1 chain watcher.
- `max_channels`: The maximum number of channels to use in the [Pipeline](./src/derive/mod.rs).
- `max_timeout`: The maximum timeout for a channel, measured by the frame's corresponding L1 block number.
- `chain`: A `ChainConfig` object detailed below.

**ChainConfig**
- `l1_start_epoch`: The L1 block number to start the L1 chain watcher at.
- `l2_genesis`: The L2 genesis block.
- `batch_sender`: The L1 address of the batch sender.
- `batch_inbox`: The batch inbox address.
- `deposit_contract`: The L1 address of the deposit contract.

The [ChainConfig](./src/config/mod.rs) contains default implementations for certain chains. For example, a `goerli` [ChainConfig](./src/config/mod.rs) instance can be created by calling `ChainConfig::goerli()`.
